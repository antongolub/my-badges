# My Badges

— _Do you like GitHub Achievements?_  
— _Do you want to get more badges?_  
— _We got you covered!_

**My Badges** is a GitHub Action that generates badges for your profile README.md.
Badges will be updated automatically every day. And you will get new badges as you progress, or
as community adds new badges. **Yes, you can [add your own badges](CONTRIBUTING.md)!**

But how does those badges look like? Check this out [here](https://github.com/antonmedv),
or [here](https://github.com/antongolub).

## Installation

Here is how to add my badges to your profile:

- Star this repository.
- Create `your-username/your-username` [GH profile repository](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme).
- In `README.md` add the following code:

```html
<!-- my-badges start -->
<!-- my-badges end -->
```

- Add the following workflow `.github/workflows/my-badges.yml` to your repository.

```yaml
name: my-badges

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'

permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  my-badges:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Update My Badges
        run: npx update-my-badges ${{github.repository_owner}}
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

- Start **my-badges** workflow, or wait for it to run automatically.

You can also perform these steps manually:
- Go to `username/username` local repo.
- Run `npx update-my-badges --user <username> --token=<token> --dryrun`.
- Verify `my-badges` and `readme.md` changes.
- Push a commit: `git add -- . ':!data' && git commit -m "chore: update my-bagdes"`.
